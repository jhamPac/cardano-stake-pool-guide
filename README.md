* any monitor that can connect with the raspberry ðŸ¥® (micro HDMI): https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/1

## Raspberry Pie ðŸ¥® setup (AcceptanceCriteria = bootloading Ubuntu from the USB storage rather than the microSD card slot $ because faster | cheaper | [better](https://www.zdnet.com/article/booting-my-raspberry-pi-4-from-a-usb-device/))
- headless setup on both pies ðŸ¥®

## Build and configure the cardano node
* resource followed: https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-ada/guide-how-to-build-a-haskell-stakepool-node
* the following tools do not come packaged with ubuntu so you need to install them via apt: git, llvm, libnuma-dev, make, libtool, jq, net-tools, fail2ban
* during the libsodium build step
  * run the configure bash script with the following argument: ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking
* correctly set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the guide has it set incorrectly: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(llvm-config --libdir):$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

## Harden Ubuntu on both raspberry pies ðŸ¥®
* follow most of the guide
* add the swap file step if necessary: https://cardano-node-installation.stakepool247.eu/adding-swap-virtual-memory
